CryptoClustering or Cryptocurrency Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Analysis
Project Overview



This project centered on clustering cryptocurrencies with the K-means algorithm and enhancing the clusters through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The process involved identifying the optimal value for k, clustering the data using both the original and PCA-reduced features, and employing various visualization methods to compare the outcomes.



Steps :


- Determine the Optimal Value for k Using the Original Data - The elbow method was applied to identify the best k value within a range of 1 to 11. - A line chart was created to display the inertia values, allowing for a visual assessment of the optimal k. - Following the analysis, the optimal value for k was established.



- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using the Original Data - A K-means model was set up with four clusters based on the optimal k value. - The model was trained using the original cryptocurrency data, predicting clusters for each currency. - The predicted clusters were incorporated into a copy of the original dataset. - An hvPlot scatter plot was generated to visualize the clusters based on price_change_percentage_24h and price_change_percentage_7d, allowing users to identify cryptocurrencies through hover interactions.



- Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - PCA was employed to reduce the dataset to three principal components. - The explained variance was computed to assess the amount of information captured by each component, along with an analysis of the total variance. - A new DataFrame containing the PCA data was generated for further analysis.



- Determine the Optimal Value for k Using the PCA Data - The elbow method was utilized on the PCA-reduced data to identify the best k within the same range. - A line chart was created to display the inertia values, and the optimal k for the PCA-reduced data was compared to that of the original data.



- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using PCA Data - A K-means model was implemented on the PCA data utilizing the optimal k value. - The resulting clusters were visualized using hvPlot, comparing the PC1 and PC2 values, with cryptocurrency names included for hover interactions.



- Visualize and Compare the Results - Composite plots were generated with hvPlot to compare the elbow curves and cluster groupings from both the original and PCA-reduced data. - The effects of utilizing fewer features (PCA) were visually examined, highlighting significant differences in cluster formation.


- Additional Analysis Techniques - t-SNE was utilized for enhanced visualization. - Correlation matrices and heatmaps were created to investigate relationships between features. - Various plots were generated to visualize the data, including a catplot to identify outliers and box plots to emphasize variance.



- Code Organization and Submission - All code adhered to Python conventions, with imports positioned at the top and functions/variables named appropriately. - DRY principles were followed to ensure the code was reusable and concise. - The repository includes a Resources folder for the dataset. - The Jupyter notebook, located outside the folder, offers comprehensive insights into the analysis, accompanied by suitable commit messages for all files.
